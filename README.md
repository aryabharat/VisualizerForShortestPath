# Visualizer for safe path

This project is a fire exit simulator based on shortest path finding in a 2D grid. It aims to simulate the evacuation process during a fire emergency and find the shortest path for individuals to reach the nearest fire exit. Path visualizer simulator for a fire exit plan inspired by [PathFinding.js](https://github.com/qiao/PathFinding.js) library for sortest path alog's. Currently using A* algo for sortest path.
